# Idea 3
> based on @bajtix 's (Bartek's) only *slightly* schizophrenic notes

## Concept
> (basically the same as in [idea 1](idea1.md))

You are an amateur-ish detective trying to solve the case of several teenagers who went missing in the Alps. A half-closed world (limited paths that the player can traverse and cannot step beyond), 2 or 3 points of interest with puzzles that possibly unlock new paths. The player is hunted by a monster (see below) which manifests its presence by affecting the environment, but stays hidden otherwise.

## Tone
> (basically the same as in [idea 1](idea1.md))

- dark
- mythological
- mysterious
- elements of psychological horror

## Characters
### The Player
Not much is revealed about the player, other than:
- they're an amateurish detective
- they're into alpinism
That might also serve the immersion, as the actual player will have an easier time identifying themself with a nameless, first-person character.

### The Monster (Tatzelwurm) 
The monster is heavily based on the legendary Tatzelwurm[^1], (in one of its interpratations) taking the form of a large (approx. 1.8 meter long, rather thick) lizard with a feline-looking face. It possesses multiple rows of teeth[^2] and has two fore- and two backlegs equipped with enormous (to the point of looking slightly oversized) claws. It is covered in white scales and appears amidst blizzards, camouflaging in the snow as it closes the distance between itself and its prey.

### The White Lady (The Wei√üe Frauen / Frau Perchta)
The concept of Perchta, one of the White (or wise) Ladies[^3] stems from germanic folklore[^4]. She's a woman who, depending on the behaviour of the person who sees her, takes the form of an immensly pretty, paleskin lady (or of an old hag). In both the forms however she posseses only one leg and uses a staff (or a cane) to walk. She's known to help those who in some regard have helped her previously, and to violently murder the mischievious or those who have hurt her. She's accompanied by a group of the royal Heimchen as they portray her as their queen. She resides in the underground land of caverns known as the Great Meadow, but sometimes (especially in winter) is known to wander on the surface, where she sometimes can be spotted by hikers passing by.

### The Heimchen
The Heimchen[^6] are believed to be the souls of unbaptized children enclosed in dwarf-like bodies and can shapeshift into house crickets if they wish. They lead their lives in the underground caverns of The Great Meadow, and a group of them accompanies Lady Prechta, who they believe to be their queen. They basically serve a decorative purpose for the game.

## Places

### Krippenstein Peak
This is the mountain the hiking trip got lost on. This is the starting location, where the player begins by getting out of a temporary cable car/ski lift. It is used by the workers to install the actual "big" cable car that will serve the tourists, but is just left operating. There is a hut there which houses the engines and police information on the case. (Possible clues?). There is also a place of skies sticking out the snow, suggesting the engineers would occasionaly take an alternative way downward.

### A temporary memorial
Heading down a trail from the peak, a forest begins. Under one of the trees (which appears suspiciously like its been scratched by giant claws) a cross made of two sticks is buried in the snow and some blood can be seen around the area. This is the place where the body of one of the teachers was found. Some clues may be hidden there.

### A lonely shrine
Heading down the trail it splits into two paths, one of which leads here. A shrine[^7] resides buried in snow in the middle of a clearing in the forest in a flatter area which ends with a cliff. You find some cracked wooden pieces there which you can rearrange.

### A strange den
The other way leads to a rock wall with a bunch of rocks (all of them suspiciously scratched) which resemble the entrence to a den of some animal. 

### The Great Meadow
This place is not meant to be explored and flashes briefly at the end. Its a cavern lit by a crystal in the middle, full of little dwarve statues. The cavern is overgrown and crystals can be seen growing from the walls.

## Story
This needs to be filled in, it is just to serve as a frame of reference but will need to get modified as we create the puzzles
1. Player starts on the peak
2. Goes down to the memorial OR if they try the other route, they fall off the cliff at the end
3. Do the puzzle stuff (yeah i know it is very general)
4. Accidentaly free the heimchen who got stuck. not freeing it leads to the bad ending
5. the clues (maybe placed INSIDE the den???) lead to the fact that mythological creatures are involved
6. as the story progresses, a snowstorm which seemed unthreatening at first becomes more and more violent
7. the earth begins to rumble and you hear a heartbeat
8. crickets appear that lead you to the peak again
9. they make you use the skis
10. get saved by a lady - turns out its perchta
11. a brief flash of the great meadow
12. the end

## Problems to be solved
- how to explain that freeing the heimchen made perchta save you

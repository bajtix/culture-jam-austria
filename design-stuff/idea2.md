# IDEA #2 
> by @Lerock (Pan Bu≈Çka) 

## Setting
The game begins in an atmospheric alpine bar, where the player is with his friend.

[This music plays in the background](https://youtu.be/HRspnOmK0Ug),
and [this sound effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSrVznkaMEM)

Then a friend proposes a bet: the player must enter a mysterious cave on the other side of the mountain. It is said that a former expedition hid there from a snowstorm, but the bodies of the group members were never found.
+ In this scene, you can add a simple mini-game, such as a card game

Player loses the bet and goes to the cave.

Soon after entering the cave, an avalanche buries the exit, cutting off the way back. 
When the player delves into the cave, he comes across old radio equipment. It is damaged, covered with rust and dust, but still works, although in a mysterious way. When turned on, the radio starts emitting strange signals.

Upon reaching the cave, he start discovering odd anomalies (strange symbols on the walls, footprints that don't belong to anyone, disappearing objects, and mysterious sounds).

The player finds a recording and the expedition's logs, which describe people's disappearances and the group's growing paranoia. The recordings suggest that something or someone was chasing them and attacked at the end

The hiking team (about 4-5 people) ran off in all directions so they started leaving notes/hints to find each other (the player, of course, finds these notes and follows them to find the exit).

Over time, the player finds the bodies of the missing people along with recordings/photos from the incident.
He realize that he is not alone. *(A mysterious black character appears and then disappears)*

## Riddles to solve
Here you can take from ideas from a game such as [*We were here*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/582500/We_Were_Here/)

## Ending
I prefer a bad ending (i.e. that our character dies, as in the game [*Iron lung*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846170/Iron_Lung/))
+ In order to build the atmosphere we need good sound effects and well done graphics (This is where the asset store comes in, so if you have any ideas send them)

Game Introduction/First cutscene:

(black background, lyrics appears)

The cold wind tugs at the branches of trees, and all you can hear is the haunting whistle of the mountain alps breeze.

You and your companion trek through the dense forest, gathering wood to start a fire and warm yourselves on this freezing night.

Your conversations grow quieter, and the silence around you becomes heavy, as though the forest has something to hide.

Then you hear something that quickens your pulse – a faint, almost inaudible sound of breaking branches.

Your companion turns, seeing something in the darkness, and fear flashes across his face.

In an instant… from the shadows emerges a creature

Its massive jaws clamp down on your companion’s body, who doesn’t even have time to react.

A scream cuts through the night’s silence. The beast flings the lifeless body aside and disappears into the dark.

Shocked, defenseless, you tumble down the steep slope, your body landing in an old, forgotten shed nearby.

You are alone. Only you and the darkness that now surrounds you in this unknown place.

You must survive… and escape this place before it's too late.
